# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Project.create(title: "Have fun!", description: "Try your best, don't get stressed!")
# User.create(username: "Jolly")
# Task.create(content: "do something nice", user_id: 1, project_id: 1)
